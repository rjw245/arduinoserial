This github repo contains some example files to get you up
and running with Arduino.

The arduinoserial folder is an Arduino IDE sketch with some basic
Arduino code. It enables the Arduino to respond to data
received over the serial connection.

arduinoSample.py is meant to be run on the host computer which
the Arduino is connected to. It will send over whatever is
entered at the terminal prompt and will print whatever response
it receives from the Arduino.
